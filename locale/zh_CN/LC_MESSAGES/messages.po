"Communication is about having a great idea and getting it across in "
"time.<br /><br />\n"
"Established in 2013, <a href=\"http://www.getmewrite.com\">Get Me "
"Write</a> provides freelance writing, editing and translation services to"
" facilitate effective communication.<br /><br />\n"
"As a freelance writer, I have worked with groups and individuals across "
"all industries: from the arts, to fashion, to beauty, to hospitality and "
"others. They had unique products or fantastic ideas, yet few managed to "
"distil those qualities into words. Often, the key message was lost in "
"translation and time.<br /><br />\n"
"To illustrate, a Chinese-to-English translation half the length of the "
"original text is a sure indication that the original meaning has been "
"regrettably abbreviated to a similar degree. And of course, it need not "
"be said that a painstakingly crafted piece of copywriting is a Pyrrhic "
"victory if it arrives a week after the product launch.<br /><br />\n"
"If you have a great or important idea, the key to nurturing, sharing and "
"promoting the idea lies in effective communication. Good writing enables "
"effective communication. It is my pleasure to help you with it. I do so "
"with the following guarantees:<br /><br />\n"
"• To be efficient and timely, always.<br />\n"
"• To be concise and precise with the use of words.<br />\n"
"• To lend originality of ideas when required.<br />\n"
"• Most importantly of all, to give the greatest care to every word I "
"write."

"准确、准时地传递创新意念，才算得上是有效率的传讯。<br /><br /><a "
"\"href=\"http://www.getmewrite.com\">Get Me Write</a> "
"是为了提供高质素文字传讯服务而成立的。<br /><br "
"/>作为自由撰稿人，我曾经接触很多不同客户，包括艺术、时装、美容、服务业等。客户大都有创新有趣的意念，却因为无法准确用文字表达，或撰稿员拖欠稿件，令意念平白流失。<br"
" /><br "
"/>举例说，如果一篇文章由中文翻译成英文后，比原文短了一半，文意一定准确不到哪里。反过来说，一篇精彩的产品简介如果比原定稿期迟了一星期才出现，文字再好，也发挥不到功用。<br"
" /><br />好的文字是有效传讯的第一步，它不但让读者明白你的意念，也把意念植根在他们脑中。<br /><br "
"/>我抱持以下承诺，为客户提供有质素的文字服务：<br /><br />- 快而准<br />- 在有需要的时候，提供创新的意念<br />- "
"认真专业地对待我写的每一份稿件"

"I am fortunate to have received a bilingual and multicultural upbringing,"
" having grown up in Hong Kong whilst receiving a thorough education in "
"Western liberal arts in London. The ability to think and write "
"effectively in Chinese and English comes naturally to me.<br /><br />\n"
"<a href=\"http://www.getmewrite.com\">Get Me Write</a> is a project that "
"grew directly from my passion in life for writing. I have always loved "
"words, both spoken and written. The world around us is a rich and "
"inexhaustible well of ideas and inspiration. In our imagination, we draw "
"them together, mould and combine them into something original and "
"creative before finally setting it into words, so that that concept or "
"vision can germinate in the minds of readers.<br /><br />\n"
"Before starting <a href=\"http://www.getmewrite.com\">Get Me Write</a>, I"
" worked as a journalist, an editor, a copywriter, a marketing specialist "
"and a translator.  Through this varied work experience, I developed an "
"adeptness at different styles of writing across different subject areas "
"(please refer to my portfolio for examples). I am keen to write press "
"materials, product descriptions, editorials, or any other form of writing"
" that will put your message across most effectively.<br /><br />\n"

"I am experienced writing on extensive topics. Below are niche topics that"
" I'm particularly familiar with. If you wish to see sample writings on "
"other topics, please email me.<br /><br />\n"
"• <strong>Art writing</strong> - The creative arts often rely on a "
"language that is difficult for an unaccustomed writer to grasp. Having "
"graduated with a BA in English Literature and Politics, and an MA in "
"Theater and Performance Studies at King’s College London, visual and "
"performance arts form a strong part of my academic background. I have "
"written and translated gallery and museum catalogues, artwork "
"descriptions for art sales, art reviews and film reviews. I have also "
"conducted and written published interviews with artists (please refer to "
"my portfolio).<br /><br />\n"
"• <strong>Translation between Chinese and English (both "
"directions)</strong> - As a writer with a facility and command of these "
"two very different languages, I can ensure the meaning you want to "
"communicate not only lives through the translation process, but is in "
"fact enhanced by it.<br /><br />\n"
"• <strong>Speeches</strong> - As a successful participant and coach, I "
"have been involved in debating at a regional level for many years. I have"
" also worked as a speech trainer. Speaking your mind effectively is made "
"easier when the words, tone and emphasis you use are shaped to your "
"needs. The assuredness of speech takes half the stage fright away.<br "
"/><br />\n"
"• <strong>Copywriting</strong> - As a former PR official, I am "
"experienced in devising creative strategies to promote products and "
"services.\n"

"以下是我经常接触的创作/写作领域一览。如欲查询我的其他作品，请电邮告知。<br /><br />- "
"<strong>艺术</strong>：艺术书写是一套独特的语言，对于没有相关经验的作者来说，很难掌握。由于我大学时修读英国文学，后在伦敦进修戏剧，因此非常熟悉视觉和表演艺术相关词汇。我曾经替画廊和博物馆编写展览场刊，撰写艺评、影评、以及艺术家访谈等。<br"
" /><br />- <strong>中英文翻译</strong>：提供中译英及英译中服务。保证传译准确。<br /><br />- "
"<strong>讲词</strong>：曾参与多项区域性比赛，及担任公开演说及辩论导师，对于如何遣词用字及掌握语调有深入认识，可因应你的需要，提供文稿写作及演说训练。<br"
" /><br />- <strong>商业/市场推广文稿</strong>：拥有市场推广经验，擅于为各类产品服务构思推广策略，以及撰写相关文件。"
