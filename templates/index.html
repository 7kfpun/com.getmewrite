{% set home = "Communication is about having a great idea and getting it across in time. Getmewrite was established to facilitate effective communication.<br /><br />
As a freelance writer, I have worked with groups and individuals across all industries: from the arts, to fashion, to beauty, to hospitality and others. They had unique products or fantastic ideas, yet few managed to distil those qualities into words. Often, the key message was lost in translation and time.<br /><br />
To illustrate, a Chinese-to-English translation is half the length of the original text is a sure indication that the original meaning has been regrettably abbreviated to a similar degree. And of course, it need not be said that a painstakingly crafted piece of copywriting is a Pyrrhic victory if it arrives a week after the product launch.<br /><br />
Therefore, if you have a great or important idea, the key to nurturing, sharing and promoting the idea lies in effective communication. Good writing enables effective communication. With it, your idea will take root organically in the minds of your readers.<br /><br />
It is my pleasure to help you get ideas across. I do so with the following guarantees:<br /><br />
&#8226; To be efficient and timely, always.<br />
&#8226; To be concise and precise with the use of words. Further editing of what I submit will not be necessary.<br />
&#8226; To lend originality of ideas when required.<br />
&#8226; Most importantly of all, to give the greatest care to every word I write. This, ultimately, makes all the difference.

{% set about = "Based in London, I established Getmewrite in August 2013 to provide professional freelance writing, editing and translation services. I am fortunate to have received a bilingual and multicultural upbringing, having grown up in Hong Kong whilst receiving a thorough education in Western liberal arts in London. The ability to think and write effectively in Chinese and English comes naturally to me.<br /><br />
Getmewrite is a project that grew directly from my passion in life for writing. I have always loved words, both spoken and written. The world around us is a rich and inexhaustible well of ideas and inspiration. In our imagination, we draw them together, mould and combine them into something original and creative before finally setting it into words, so that that concept or vision can germinate in the minds of readers.<br /><br />
Before starting Getmewrite, I worked as a journalist, an editor, a copywriter, a marketing specialist and a translator. Through this varied work experience, I developed an adeptness at different styles of writing across different subject areas (please refer to my portfolio for examples). I am keen to write press materials, product descriptions, editorials, or any other form of writing that will put your message across most effectively.<br /><br />
To find out more about my previous work, please have a look at the \"Portfolio\" Section.
" %}

{% set portfolio = "I am experienced writing on extensive topics. Below are niche topics that I’m particularly familiar with. If you wish to see sample writings on other topics, please email me.<br /><br />
&#8226; <strong>Art writing</strong> - The creative arts often rely on a language that is difficult for an unaccustomed writer to grasp. Having graduated with a BA in English Literature and Politics, and an MA in Theater and Performance Studies at King’s College London, visual and performance arts form a strong part of my academic background. I have written and translated gallery and museum catalogues, artwork descriptions for art sales, art reviews and film reviews. I have also conducted and written published interviews with artists (please refer to my portfolio).<br /><br />
&#8226; <strong>Translation between Chinese and English (both directions)</strong>: As a writer with a facility and command of these two very different languages, I can ensure the meaning you want to communicate not only lives through the translation process, but is in fact enhanced by it.<br /><br />
&#8226; <strong>Speeches</strong> - As a successful participant and coach, I have been involved in debating at a regional level for many years. I have also worked as a speech trainer. Speaking your mind effectively is made easier when the words, tone and emphasis you use are shaped to your needs. The assuredness of speech takes half the stage fright away.<br /><br />
